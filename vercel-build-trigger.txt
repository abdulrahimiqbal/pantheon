TRIGGER-021-CLEAN-CONFIG-FIX

Build ID: TRIGGER-021-CLEAN-CONFIG-FIX
Timestamp: 2025-07-05 20:00:00
Purpose: Remove ALL runtime specifications causing deployment errors

CRITICAL FIX:
- Removed api/test.py configuration from vercel.json (file was deleted but config remained)
- This was causing "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" error
- Now only api/index.py is configured (no runtime specified = auto-detect)
- Completely clean configuration

ERROR ROOT CAUSE:
- api/test.py had "runtime": "python3.9" in vercel.json
- File was deleted but configuration remained
- Vercel tried to deploy non-existent function with invalid runtime spec
- This caused the build failure

SOLUTION:
- Removed ALL references to api/test.py from vercel.json
- Only api/index.py configured with maxDuration only
- No runtime specifications anywhere
- Clean, minimal configuration

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Build should proceed without runtime errors
- Only api/index.py function will be deployed
- Auto-detected Python runtime
- All API endpoints should work
