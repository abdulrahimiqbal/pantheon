TRIGGER-016-COMPLETE-ROUTING-FIX

Build ID: TRIGGER-016-COMPLETE-ROUTING-FIX
Timestamp: 2024-12-19 17:15:00
Purpose: Complete elimination of redirect loops

MAJOR CHANGES:
1. Removed ALL rewrites/routes from vercel.json
2. Using Vercel's native routing: static files served from /public, API from /api/*
3. Created proper index.html in /public with full frontend
4. Simplified api/index.py to just export FastAPI app
5. No more redirects, no more conflicts

ARCHITECTURE:
- Static frontend: /public/index.html → served at /
- API functions: /api/index.py → served at /api/*
- Clean separation, no routing conflicts

This file exists solely to trigger Vercel builds when GitHub pushes occur.
Each change to this file should trigger a new deployment.
