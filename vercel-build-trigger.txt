TRIGGER-020-RUNTIME-VERSION-FIX

Build ID: TRIGGER-020-RUNTIME-VERSION-FIX
Timestamp: 2025-07-05 19:55:00
Purpose: Fix "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" error

CRITICAL FIX:
- Removed explicit "runtime": "python3.9" specification
- Let Vercel auto-detect Python runtime from .py file extension
- Removed unnecessary api/test.py function
- Simplified vercel.json configuration

ERROR RESOLVED:
- "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" error fixed
- Vercel will now auto-detect Python runtime correctly
- Only essential api/index.py function configured

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Deployment should proceed without runtime errors
- Python function should deploy successfully
- All API endpoints should work correctly

ARCHITECTURE:
- Static frontend: /public/index.html → served at /
- API function: /api/index.py → served at /api/* (auto-detected runtime)
- Clean configuration, no runtime conflicts

This file exists solely to trigger Vercel builds when GitHub pushes occur.
Each change to this file should trigger a new deployment.
