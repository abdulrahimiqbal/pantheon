TRIGGER-017-API-ROUTING-FIX

Build ID: TRIGGER-017-API-ROUTING-FIX
Timestamp: 2024-12-19 17:30:00
Purpose: Fix API routing to return JSON instead of HTML

CRITICAL FIXES:
1. Fixed FastAPI routes to remove /api/ prefix (Vercel adds it automatically)
2. Removed conflicting frontend route from FastAPI app
3. Clean separation: static files serve frontend, API functions serve JSON
4. Fixed api/index.py to properly export FastAPI app
5. Updated route paths: /health, /physics/query, /agents/status, /config

ARCHITECTURE:
- Static frontend: /public/index.html → served at /
- API functions: /api/index.py → serves JSON at /api/*
- No more HTML/JSON conflicts, proper Content-Type headers

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Frontend loads properly from static files
- API calls return JSON (not HTML)
- No more "Unexpected token 'T'" errors
- Proper API status display
