TRIGGER-019-RUNTIME-CONFIG-FIX

Build ID: TRIGGER-019-RUNTIME-CONFIG-FIX
Timestamp: 2024-12-19 18:00:00
Purpose: Fix Python runtime configuration and function deployment

CRITICAL ISSUE:
- Both complex FastAPI function and simple test function returning "The page could not be found"
- Suggests fundamental issue with Python function deployment on Vercel
- No functions are being recognized/deployed properly

FIXES APPLIED:
1. Added explicit "runtime": "python3.9" to all functions in vercel.json
2. Created simple test function (api/test.py) using BaseHTTPRequestHandler
3. Configured both api/index.py and api/test.py in functions section
4. Using Python 3.9 runtime (known to work with Vercel)

DEBUGGING STEPS:
- Test simple function: /api/test should return JSON
- Test main function: /api/health should return JSON
- Check if runtime specification resolves deployment issues
- Verify function logs show successful deployment

EXPECTED RESULT:
- /api/test should return: {"status": "working", "message": "Simple test function is working"}
- /api/health should return: {"status": "healthy", "service": "pantheon-physics-swarm"}
- No more "The page could not be found" errors
- Python functions should be properly recognized and deployed

This file exists solely to trigger Vercel builds when GitHub pushes occur.
