5. **Agent Management System**
   - [ ] Implement agent manager with CRUD operations
   - [ ] Create agent registration and discovery
   - [ ] Add agent health monitoring
   - [ ] Implement agent scaling logic

6. **Task Scheduling**
   - [ ] Create task queue with Celery
   - [ ] Implement task prioritization
   - [ ] Add task timeout and retry logic
   - [ ] Create task result storage

#### Phase 3: Agent Implementation
7. **Specialist Agents**
   - [ ] Research Agent (web scraping, fact-checking)
   - [ ] Analysis Agent (data processing, insights)
   - [ ] Writing Agent (content generation, editing)
   - [ ] Coding Agent (code generation, review)

8. **Communication System**
   - [ ] Inter-agent messaging protocol
   - [ ] Message routing and delivery
   - [ ] Conversation history tracking
   - [ ] Conflict resolution mechanisms

#### Phase 4: Frontend Dashboard
9. **Next.js Dashboard**
   - [ ] Set up Next.js with TypeScript
   - [ ] Create agent monitoring components
   - [ ] Implement task management interface
   - [ ] Add real-time updates with WebSocket
   - [ ] Create workflow visualization

10. **User Interface**
    - [ ] Agent configuration panels
    - [ ] Task creation and monitoring
    - [ ] Performance metrics dashboard
    - [ ] System health indicators

#### Phase 5: Advanced Features
11. **Workflow Engine**
    - [ ] Multi-agent workflow definition
    - [ ] Workflow execution engine
    - [ ] Conditional logic and branching
    - [ ] Workflow templates and reusability

12. **Monitoring and Analytics**
    - [ ] Prometheus metrics collection
    - [ ] Grafana dashboards
    - [ ] Performance analytics
    - [ ] Error tracking and alerting

### üîß Technical Decisions Made

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Backend: FastAPI + Python 3.11+
   - Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript
   - Database: PostgreSQL + Redis
   - Task Queue: Celery
   - Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

2. **Architecture Patterns**
   - Microservices with Docker containers
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Event-driven communication
   - RESTful API with WebSocket support

3. **AI Integration**
   - OpenAI GPT models for general tasks
   - Anthropic Claude for analysis
   - Hugging Face for open-source models
   - LangChain for LLM orchestration

### üìã Development Guidelines

#### Code Standards
- Python: PEP 8, Black formatting, type hints
- TypeScript: Strict mode, ESLint, Prettier
- Git: Conventional commits, feature branches
- Testing: Unit tests with pytest, integration tests

#### Collaboration Workflow
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Run linting and formatting
4. Submit pull request with description
5. Code review and merge to main

### üéØ Immediate Next Actions

**For the next development session:**

1. **Set up shared module** - Create the foundation types and utilities
2. **Initialize database** - Set up models and migrations
3. **Create base agent class** - Define the agent interface
4. **Start FastAPI app** - Basic application structure

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start development
npm run dev
```

### ü§ù Team Collaboration

This project is designed for collaborative development:
- Clear separation of concerns between components
- Well-defined interfaces between layers
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Docker setup for consistent development environment
- Automated testing and quality checks
